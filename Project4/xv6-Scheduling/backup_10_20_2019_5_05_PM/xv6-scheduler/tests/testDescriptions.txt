Abbyâ€™s Test Case Descriptions

1.Testing that loop is runnable
2.Testing that userRR is runnable
3.Test that set_pri correctly sets the priority (Uses get_pri)
4.Tests for error return value from set_pri for invalid PID
5.Tests for error return value from set_pri for invalid priority
6.Tests for error return value from get_pri for invalid PID
7.Tests that getpinfo correctly updates pstat after forking 2 processes and setting their priorities
8.Tests for error return value from getpinfo for null stat pointer
9.Tests that fork2 forks a child and sets its priority properly
10.Tests for error return value from fork2 for invalid priority
11.Checks round robin behavior of one child process in priority queue 2
